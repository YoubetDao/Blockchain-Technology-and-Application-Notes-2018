# Blockchain-Technology-and-Application-Notes-2018

Welcome to the **Blockchain-Technology-and-Application-Notes-2018**! This repository contains notes, resources, and references for the course ["Blockchain Technology and Application"](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Vt411X7JF) taught by Professor Zhen Xiao in 2018.

## Overview

This course focuses on the fundamental concepts and implementation principles of blockchain technology. It is designed for students with a basic understanding of computer science who are interested in blockchain technology and its applications. By the end of the course, students will have a solid grasp of the design principles behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain technologies, as well as the ability to apply these principles to solve practical problems.

### Course Highlights:
- **Instructor**: Professor Zhen Xiao
- **Award**: Professor Zhen Xiao received the 2018 Peking University Teaching Excellence Award for this course.
- **Course Format**: The course is primarily taught through lectures and blackboard notes. While slides are provided, they are supplementary and should be used in conjunction with the course videos for a complete understanding.

### Program Structure

This is an open 8-week learning plan, divided into two phases: BTC and ETH.

The first half focuses on general understanding of blockchain and Bitcoin fundamentals. The second half will cover practical and reflective topics around Ethereum, smart contracts, and related concepts. Each track will include deeper dives into specific topics in the R&D field.

Each online session will be hosted by core developers and researchers, with pre-session reading materials provided to familiarize you with the topics and terminology, and post-session activities to reinforce and solidify your understanding.

Weekly themes, presentations, and materials can be found in this folder. Check the study group content starting from Week 0 in this folder.

### Schedule

The first part of the program includes 4 weeks of blockchain knowledge and an introduction to BTC.

**Date | Topic | Speaker**

October 3 | Course Introduction | Bitcoin | Weir
October 8 | Cryptographic Principles | Data Structures | Douzi
October 10 | Consensus Protocols | Execution | Weir
October 15 | Networking | Mining Difficulty | Douzi
October 17 | Mining | Scripting | Weir
October 22 | Forks | Q&A | Douzi
October 24 | Anonymity | Reflections on Bitcoin | Weir

The second part of the program will cover Ethereum and smart contracts. Detailed schedule to be announced.

### Participation

The first instance of the study group will begin in October 2024. It is completely open and permissionless, and each participant can choose how they wish to engage. Whether you want to learn as much as possible, focus only on specific topics, or share your knowledge with others, you are welcome. Although it is open, you can register to help us better tailor the experience.

Join our community Discord server.

Study group participants will collaboratively develop a comprehensive wiki that will serve as a continuously evolving knowledge base for current and future core developers. This will provide students with hands-on experience in contributing to open-source resources while gaining valuable experience in documentation writing and community-driven development.

The study group is open to anyone interested in learning the inner workings of blockchain, Bitcoin, and Ethereum protocols. Those with some general knowledge or experience with Ethereum and/or blockchain, as well as those with backgrounds in computer science, technology, or development, will benefit most from the program.
